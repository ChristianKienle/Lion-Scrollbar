This repository brings the new Lion scroll bars to Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6). The Xcode project contains two classes:

- CMKScrollView
- CMKScroller

You can use the Lion Scroll View on a per scroll view basis. Simply select the scroll view in Interface Builder/Xcode and change the class from NSScrollView to CMKScrollView. Do the same with the scrollers embedded in the scroll view. Done.

The Xcode project contains an example application.
